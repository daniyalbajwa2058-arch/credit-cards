💳 Credit Card Default Prediction (Machine Learning)
📌 Project Overview

Credit card default is a serious risk for financial institutions. This machine learning project predicts whether a customer is likely to default on a credit card payment based on historical financial data, spending patterns, and customer information. The goal is to help banks and financial companies reduce risk and make better credit decisions.

This repository demonstrates a complete ML workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and prediction.
